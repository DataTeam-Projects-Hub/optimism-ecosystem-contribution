The total result would be 60% of sequencer ETH staked (6,195 ETH) across three custodians.  Upon approval of this proposal, an initial 20%, or 2,065 ETH, will be staked with BitGo within 10 days of approval. The remaining 40% will be staked once onboarded to additional providers (Coinbase and Kraken.)  This proposal would be in effect until the end of Season 8 (Dec 2025), when it would need to be renewed.

It contains consensus changes which, by default, would cause all OP Stack chains to halt.   In particular: - a new transaction type (and corresponding receipt type) is introduced by [EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md). - a new field in the block header is introduced by [EIP-7685](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685)  Upgrade 12 is a maintenance upgrade which consists of changes to - Node software - Optimism protocol specifications and - L1 Fault Proofs smart contract system(s) to elegantly handle activation of the Pectra hardfork on L1 networks.  The expected outcome is that OP Stack chains continue to operate as before (they do not halt) when Pectra activates on their respective L1 chains.

    "proposal_title":"Retro Funding S7 - Dev Tooling - Eval Algos",
    "proposal_description":"Hey everyone, Carl from [Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/) here, sharing the evaluation algorithms for Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) Season 7: Dev Tooling.  The Dev Tooling mission seeks to reward projects based on the utility they provide to builders in developing onchain applications. See the [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-dev-tooling-mission-details/9598) for more on the mission's objectives.  This season, Optimism's Retro Funding is pioneering a \"metrics-driven, humans-in-the-loop\" approach. Instead of voting on projects, citizens vote on evaluation algorithms. Each algorithm represents a different strategy for rewarding projects. Algorithms will evolve in response to voting, community feedback, and new ideas over the course of the season.  Here's a tl;dr of the three algorithms:  |Algorithm|Goal|Best For|Emphasis| | --- | --- | --- | --- | |Arcturus|Reward widely adopted projects|Established, high-impact devtooling projects|Prioritizes total dependents and the economic weight of those dependents| |Bellatrix|Prioritize fast-growing tools|New or rapidly expanding devtooling projects|Applies a steep decay factor on older forms of GitHub engagement, favors Rust over npm| |Canopus|Balance various forms of contribution|Tools with high developer collaboration & contributions|Puts stronger emphasis on GitHub engagement and developer reputation|  ### Metrics Overview  The algorithms all rely on a value chain graph linking dev tools to onchain builders and use [OpenRank's EigenTrust implementation](https://docs.openrank.com/reputation-algorithms/eigentrust) to distribute trust between projects iteratively.  #### Nodes  There are three types of core nodes in the graph:  * Onchain Projects, which hold economic pretrust and pass it on. * Developers, who gain partial trust from the onchain projects they contribute to. * Devtooling Projects, which receive trust both directly from onchain projects, via package dependencies, and indirectly from developers' GitHub engagement.  #### Edges  Links between nodes, i.e., edges, are derived from the following relationships:  1. Onchain Projects → Devtooling Projects (Package Dependencies). For each package in the onchain project's [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository), if that package is owned by a devtooling project, we add an edge from the onchain project to the devtooling project. 2. Onchain Projects → Developers (Commits). Whenever a developer commits code (or merges PRs) in an onchain project's GitHub repository, we add an edge from the onchain project to that developer. 3. Developers → Devtooling Projects (GitHub Engagement). Whenever a developer (from the set recognized above) engages with a devtooling project (commits, PRs, issues, forks, stars, or comments), we add an edge from that developer to the devtooling project.  #### Pre-trust Assumptions  Metrics about projects and developers are used as a way of seeding the EigenTrust algorithm with pretrust assumptions. All other things being equal, edges that involve nodes with higher pretrust values will be weighted more heavily in the EigenTrust algorithm.  Pretrust metrics are applied to each node in the graph:  1. Onchain Projects. Transaction volumes, gas fees, and user counts over the past 180 days. 2. Devtooling Projects. Count of published packages and GitHub metrics (stars, forks). 3. Developer Reputation. Active months contributing to one or more onchain projects.  #### Weighting Assumptions  After constructing the graph and computing pretrust scores, we assign final weights to each edge before EigenTrust runs:  1. Alpha: the portion of the EigenTrust output taken from the pretrust values vs. the iterative trust propagation step. 2. Time Decay: an exponential decay factor so that newer events get weighted more heavily than older events. 3. Link and Event Types: coefficients for weighting certain types of links more heavily (e.g., Rust imports more heavily than npm imports).  Each algorithm has its own set of weighting assumptions.  ### Proposed Algorithms  We've developed an initial three candidate algorithms for evaluating impact. Each algorithm highlights different priorities: Arcturus focuses on established adoption, Bellatrix puts more emphasis on emerging toolchains, and Canopus aims to look more closely at the quality of the developer community around a project.  We've included details on each algorithm below. We also have a [Hex dashboard](https://app.hex.tech/00bffd76-9d33-4243-8e7e-9add359f25c7/app/d5da455e-b49a-47d6-a88d-dce1f679a02b/latest) where you can see data on each algorithm.  *Important: as projects are still signing up for the current measurement period, we simulated the results for each algorithm using past Retro Funding participants and historical data. The “top projects” below are based on onchain builders applications from RF4 and devtooling projects from RF3.*  #### Arcturus  Arcturus rewards projects with significant current adoption by focusing on total dependents and downstream impact. It emphasizes the number of developers and onchain users benefiting from these tools, ensuring that cornerstone infrastructure is properly recognized. By applying only a modest discount to older events, Arcturus is best suited for rewarding established projects that many builders rely on.  ![dt1.png](ipfs://bafkreif3b2xlpa2ig4wxeik4bzhp56tblkvhkxi2dyuz66v4pt6jqg5dhq)  Top projects (using simulated data):  1.

[Prettier Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity)  #### Bellatrix  Bellatrix is designed to spotlight projects and toolchains that are gaining in momentum. It applies a steep decay factor on older GitHub engagements and favors modern tooling preferences, notably prioritizing Rust over npm packages. This approach makes Bellatrix ideal for giving an edge to devtooling projects that are on the rise.  ![dt2.png](ipfs://bafkreibpnebud4dodq3mjhfcqkntptqzfohmhs6vvybn3cugavjh2xbdgi)  Top projects (using simulated data):  1.

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs)  #### Canopus  Canopus recognizes projects that have large active developer communities. It considers package dependencies alongside developer interactions, but puts extra weight on key GitHub engagement signals – such as commits, pull requests, and issue discussions. The result is a more balanced distribution of rewards across a broader variety of projects (not just the very biggest or newest). This approach can be a bit more susceptible to noise, since it values a wider range of contribution types, but it aims to ensure broader open source contributions are well-represented.  ![dt3.png](ipfs://bafkreihyuzmhfrfmjg2jh4awbm6pdfepm5ohagnftoj6fdojvfjj2c4khu)  Top projects (using simulated data):  1.

[DefiLlama](https://github.com/defillama)  ### How to Vote  One of the proposed evaluation algorithm for the **Dev Tooling** mission will be chosen using [approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting). This means you can approve one or multiple options. For an algorithm to be selected, it must meet the following conditions:  - Quorum**:** At least 30% (44) of badgeholders must participate in the vote. - Approval Threshold**:** An algorithm must receive approval from at least 51% of quorum (22 badgeholders)  The algorithm with the most approvals, provided it meets the thresholds, will be used for the remainder of Season 7.  To learn more about this mission, please see the [Dev Tooling Mission Details](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-dev-tooling-mission-details/9598). We also have more in-depth documentation on these algorithms in the [Retro Funding repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/tree/main/eval-algos/S7).  If you have ideas on refining these models, let us know in the comments. And, if you want to contribute to making these algorithms better, submit a PR or open an issue [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding).",

The Onchain Builders Mission seeks to reward protocols and dapps that demonstrate meaningful onchain usage, drive TVL growth, and support interop across the Superchain. See [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-onchain-builders-mission-details/9611) for more on the mission's objectives.  This season, Optimism's Retro Funding is pioneering a \"metrics-driven, humans-in-the-loop\" approach. Instead of voting on projects, citizens vote on evaluation algorithms. Each algorithm represents a different strategy for rewarding projects. Algorithms will evolve in response to voting, community feedback, and new ideas over the course of the season.  Here's a tl;dr of the three algorithms:  |Algorithm|Goal|Best For|Emphasis| | --- | --- | --- | --- | |Superscale|Reward clear-cut leaders|Large, established projects with high usage|Adoption (favors projects with high recent activity)| |Acceleratooor|Prioritize fast-growing projects|New and emerging projects gaining traction|Growth (favors projects with the largest net increase in impact)| |Goldilocks|Achieve a more balanced distribution|Consistently active projects with steady engagement|Retention (favors projects maintaining impact over time)|  ### Metrics Overview  #### Project-Level Metrics  Each project's score is based on four key metrics:  1. TVL. The average Total Value Locked (in USD) during the measurement period, focusing on ETH, stablecoins, and eventually other qualified assets. 2. Transaction Counts. The count of unique, successful transaction hashes that result in a state change and involve one or more of a project's contracts on the Superchain. 3. Gas Fees. The total L2 gas (gas consumed * gas price) for all successful transactions that results in a state change and involve one or more of a project's contracts on the Superchain. 4. Monthly Active Users. The count of unique Farcaster IDs linked to addresses that initiated an event producing a state change with one or more of a project's contracts.  #### Time-Based Variants  For each core metric (i.e., transactions, gas fees, TVL, user counts), we present three variants for comparing the values for the current period vs. the previous period. Each algorithm we present has a different weighting of these variants.  1. Adoption. The value for the current period only (e.g., the current month's transaction count). This captures the current level of adoption. 2. Growth. The positive difference between the current period and the previous period (e.g., net increase in TVL). Values are clipped at 0 if they decrease (no penalty for a decline, but no bonus, either). 3. Retention. The minimum between the current period and the previous period (e.g., how much of last month's TVL is still here). This variant rewards projects that post more consistent metrics over time.  ## Proposed Algorithms  We've developed an initial three candidate algorithms for evaluating impact. Each algorithm highlights different priorities: Superscale focuses on established, high-volume projects, Acceleratooor emphasizes rapid growth, and Goldilocks tries to balance adoption, growth, and retention.  We've included details on each algorithm below. We also have a [Hex dashboard](https://app.hex.tech/00bffd76-9d33-4243-8e7e-9add359f25c7/app/067ac30b-ef55-452c-891c-cf4dff9d86c9/latest) where you can see data on each algorithm.  *Important: as projects are still signing up for the current measurement period, we simulated the results for each algorithm using past Retro Funding participants and historical data. The “top projects” below are based on applications from RF4 and data from Dec / Jan.*  ### Superscale  This algorithm aims to reward projects with significant current usage and established impact. It places heavier weights on the most recent values of TVL and transaction metrics, and less weight on user numbers. This strategy aims to embody the philosophy of \"it's easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful\". You should vote for this algorithm if you want to keep things simple and give the projects that are having the most impact right now the recognition they deserve.  Weightings & Sample Results:  ![oc1.png](ipfs://bafkreihff2mgmhfp5blx2yuty5z63qhejkshe2e3cmlgtmqjvcwh6mruhi)  Top projects (using simulated data):  1. Aerodrome 2. Aave 3. Virtuals Protocol 4. Moonwell 5. Zora  ### Acceleratooor  This algorithm seeks to reward projects experiencing rapid growth over the current measurement period. In particular, it emphasizes growth (i.e., net increases) in TVL and transaction volume. The goal is to spot breakout stars and accelerate them. This is a good algorithm to vote for if you want to create a strong signal for rising projects that the Superchain is the place to be.  ![oc2.png](ipfs://bafkreigcohi2p7qt3224n4tikp5iobdsd725kwkknvsgezrdilahdzlqj4)  Top projects (using simulated data):  1. Aave 2. Aerodrome 3. Virtuals Protocol 4. Compound Finance 5. Paragraph  ### Goldilocks  This algorithm seeks to evenly balance various aspects of impact. It places a moderate weight on each metric and prioritizes retention over sheer growth. The goal is to support steady, sustained contributions across the board rather than “spiky” projects that only excel in one area. This is a good algorithm to vote for if you want to support a wide range of projects.  ![oc3.png](ipfs://bafkreif2x75gemxuifzsxssafoqetxaudi4jwvgfaqnsrbjvlb5aithtie)  Top projects (using simulated data):  1. Aerodrome 2. Zora 3. Aave 4. Layer3 5. LI. FI  ### How to Vote  One of the proposed evaluation algorithm for the **Onchain Builders** mission will be chosen using [approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting). This means you can approve one or multiple options. For an algorithm to be selected, it must meet the following conditions:  - Quorum**:** At least 30% (44) of badgeholders must participate in the vote. - Approval Threshold**:** An algorithm must receive approval from at least 51% of quorum (22 badgeholders)  The algorithm with the most approvals, provided it meets the thresholds, will be used for the remainder of Season 7.  To learn more about this mission, please see the [Onchain Builders Mission Details](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-onchain-builders-mission-details/9611). We also have more in-depth documentation on these algorithms in these algorithms in the [Retro Funding repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/tree/main/eval-algos/S7).  If you have ideas on refining these models, let us know in the comments. And if you'd like to contribute to making these algorithms better, you can submit a PR or open an issue [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding).",

A vote of 100% indicates that you would like the votes of Guests to be weighted equally to the votes of Citizens. i.e. 1 Guest Vote = 1 Citizen vote. A vote of 0% indicates that you would like the votes of Guests to be completely ignored and not included in the results calculation. Selecting between 100% and 0% will weigh the votes proportionally.   **Important: in this vote, the median response will be selected and executed in the results calculation, not the most common response.**  Citizen and Guest Allocations In order to help you decide how to vote, the preliminary results have been calculated based on the ballots of Citizens and Guests separately.

    "proposal_title":"Ratification of Round 4 Profit Definition",
    "proposal_description":"### Impact = profit  Optimism's Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) has been built around the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded as: ***Impact = profit.*** This principle serves as a North Star to motivate the creation of a more productive and sustainable ecosystem.  In previous Retro Funding rounds, each Citizen conducted their own assessment of impact and decided how to calculate profit by considering the past rewards received by projects and deducting that amount from impact to arrive at a final OP allocation. This non-standardized approach sparked [various debates](https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-role-of-vc-funding-in-retropgf/7342) within the community about whether external funding (e.g., VC funding, Optimism grants, or external grants) should be deducted from a project's overall public goods funding reward.  ### Round 4 Definition   In [Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988/3), a definition of profit will be universally applied to the retro round. Badgeholders will no longer need to calculate profit, but instead, a collective definition will be applied and subtracted from each voter's assessment of impact as such:  >  ***Impact - Past transfers = Award in OP***  The possible categories considered as Past Transfers are:  - Grants from Optimism - VC funding  - Grants from other ecosystems  - Revenue.   All data collected on this categories in the Round 4 application process was for the timeframe of Jan 2023 - May 23rd, 2024.  ---   ### Deliberative Process   Over the past month, a randomly selected subset of badgeholders [experimented with a deliberative process](https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041) to determine this profit definition for Round 4. You can access the public documentation of this process below. **We encourage you to review this documentation so you have the full context to vote on this proposal.**    * **Session 1:**   * [Pre-reading Info Kit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozOsXETe13EarMG6Fk2yc_vfo4V6h4clnsWubyy3tyE/edit?usp=sharing)   * The plenary session recording for Session 1 is unfortunately unusable   * [Forum recap](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083/11?u=lavande) * **Session 2:**   * [Pre-reading Info Kit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmVq4CvBrX6CcAzCYrhyh-ZDC1D7GIXGkEybGCMbVGs/edit?usp=sharing)   * [Plenary session recording](https://missionspubliques.zoom.us/rec/share/jNWsFgSa4kiDyM7tTkK7N12W1DbPFqd_2pVU-JzEnnBozD9S_d3xabyv6pF2gyB2.hteAvKOlclO7MqB-) (doesn't include breakout rooms) - Kenncode: 6R2W*ORW   * [Forum recap](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083/12?u=lavande)  * **Session 3:**   * [Pre-reading Info Kit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KC7EAAokxbH7N0YGHP6xVEXZKYCS9ZMa1LZubh8O8bs/edit?usp=sharing)   * [Plenary session recording](https://missionspubliques.zoom.us/rec/share/Q_a-4y0Apsa4dgO4n9B9TV0F6fxpQeQOtTRwKqeF2zdZpJmWIsq6bULTR8aRIzjV.om91tDLiBmH8G8kl) (doesn't include breakout rooms) - Kenncode: U1uN9!6L   * [Forum recap](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083/15?u=lavande)  This [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK-3OHHU=/?moveToWidget=3458764592049624735&cot=14) was used to collect input in all three sessions.  ---  ### Proposed Round 4 Profit Definition  #### Session 1 Vote  Participating badgeholders were asked to determine the profit definition taking into account **the specific category definitions and limitations on data collection as it applies practically in Round 4.** It is important to understand the nuance and complexity of the practical implementation of defining profit which are distinct from philosophical debates about inclusion or exclusion of each category. Two votes occurred during the deliberative process experiment. The first was on which categories to include in the profit definition. The results can be found in the original link on the Optimism Forum:   Based on the Collective's standard 51% approval threshold, these results determined that a **deduction weight would only be applied only to Optimism Grants.**   #### Session 2 Vote The second vote was on the deduction weight that should be applied to Optimism Grants, as broken into three sub-categories:  - Token House growth grants, which are passed on to end users - Token House builders grants, which are locked for one year - Foundation grants and Missions - *Past Retro Funding is not included as the evaluation period begins after the end of Round 3 The responses resulted in a proposed profit definition of Round 4 as outlined in the original link on the Optimism Forum:       ### Ratification   If you wish to ratify the below definition, which will be globally and automatically applied to the voting result calculation in Round 4, please vote “Yes” on this proposal.   >   **Impact - ((10% * Token House Growth Grants) + (45% * Token House Builders Grants) + (25% * Foundation Grants)) = Award in OP**  If you do not wish to ratify this definition, a fallback definition proposed by the Foundation will be globally and automatically applied to the voting result calculation in Round 4 instead. This definition is:   > **Impact = Award in OP**  The deliberative process experiment surfaced the amount of complexity, nuance, and effort required to accurately define profit and the challenges in verifying self-reported profit data which is oftentimes not publicly disclosed. In light of these learnings, the Foundation believes it is premature to accurately calculate profit and instead proposes solely focusing on impact in Round 4. The fallback profit definition below, will be implemented if this proposal is not ratified.  If you don't agree with the profit definition but still ratify it because you prefer it to the Foundation's proposed alternative, please explain your rationale under the proposal draft on the forum.  **Quorum will require 30% of badgeholders to cast a vote with an approval threshold will be 51% of votes cast.**",

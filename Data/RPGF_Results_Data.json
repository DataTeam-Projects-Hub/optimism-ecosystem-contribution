TL;DR:  - LogX is like 1inch for perps - helping on-chain traders find the best execution for their perp trades - LogX is also the leading Perp DEX on layer 2 networks including Mode Network and Optimism Main-Net. LogX pioneered and launched our own native perps on L2s like Mode Network with an innovative “Discrete Asset, Market Neutral” (DAMN) AMM pools. These pools take in stable assets like USDT, USDC, wUSDM, etc. and enable oracle-based perp trading to traders. - Backed by reputed investors like Sequoia Capital (India), Coinbase Ventures, IOSG, Hashed and more! - Crossed $15B in trading volume with more than 155k wallets in 9 months of operation.  Since our inception, LogX’s mission has been to make the experience of trading on-chain bigger and better than CeFi, and through that onboard CEX users to DEXes. In fact this mission has remained unaltered ever since we wrote about it in our introduction blog in 2023 here: https://flintlabs.medium.com/flint-labs-next-chapter-7e56a87f4f5e  In our 9 months of operation, we have boldly explored various offerings for different trader segments. We identified two primary trader segments: pro traders desiring orderbook functionality and tools, and those seeking a simpler UX for multi-chain exploration. So we built LogX Pro for the former and LogX OG for the latter.  LogX Pro is an Orderbook based Perp Dex which is live on Optimism Main-net, Arbitrum  and Base Network.  LogX OG is a Perp DEX which is based on our own AMM pools.  **Our Competitive Edge and Uniqueness:**  - Low-Cost, High Liquidity Offering: LogX offers unmatched cost efficiency and high liquidity across multiple trading pairs, setting a new benchmark in the decentralized trading space. - Technological Superiority: Our innovative DAMN based AMM pool enables us to launch a perpetual dex on newer networks and ecosystems like Mode network at a speed unheard of. We were the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network and bootstrapped liquidity to more than $3M in TVL and $1.3B in trading volume  **Growth**  LogX has been one of the fastest growing Perp DEXes on layer 2 networks. We were also the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network in the first week of Main-net launch and are still the largest perp dex on Mode Network. We were the preferred strategic launch partner for Mode Network.   Sharing some metrics for LogX’s performance on the Mode Network.  - TVL: $3M - Unique wallet addresses (lifetime): 30,000 - Total trading volume lifetime(March-May): $1.3B - Avg DAU(last 30 days): 250  LogX is also deployed on Optimism Main-net through their LogX Pro product which is an Orderbook based Perp Dex powered by the Orderly Network and has crossed $12B in trading volume with more than 30,000 wallets on the Optimism and Arbitrum Network combined.  LogX’s overall performance across all the deployed L2s can be found here: https://app.logx.trade/dashboard  The whole premise of LogX is based built upon composability. LogX does not only integrate with other composable protocols, but other protocols can also integrate LogX. Applications like wallets, copy trading platforms, analytics platforms, etc. can find seamless composability with LogX.  This is important to us because LogX would not have existed if not for the composability of other protocols. We owe our existence to it, and want to ensure that other protocols and apps can build on top of LogX to unlock new value props.",

It’s built on three core components: the FXH token, art coins, and a new medium called open-form generative art. The FXH token is the backbone of an entire art ecosystem. It enables efficient markets, supports governance, and aligns incentives between artists, collectors, and traders.  Art coins are ERC20 tokens launched by artists. They create dedicated economies around artists and their communities. Use art coins to mint and engage with artworks, reducing supply and balancing coins with their associated projects. They drive value across the ecosystem: Artists: earn from mint fees, trading fees, and coin speculation Collectors : earn mint fees when they curate open-form editions Traders: gain access to liquid markets for trading artist momentum  Open-form is the first application of the $FXH protocool. Generative art that continues evolving after mint. Rather than static outputs, it creates living algorithms where artists update code over time and collectors discover, curate, and extend remarkable outputs. We will expand this protocol to cover all aspects of digital contemporary art, allowing all artists to leverage the potential of tapping into the next frontier of NFTs.

Over 49,394 streams have been started on Optimism and 644,584 on Base for a combined total volume of over $280M.  Superfluid is designed to minimize its TVL in favor of making assets available to sender or recipient at all times, minimizing funds locked in smart contracts. As such its impact is better measures in total volume transferred, number of total or active streams, total number of users and daily active users. When measuring the protocol activity it's important to not only rely on the on-chain transaction to smart contracts, but also on the the inner mechanics of the protocol (i.e. by evaluating the actions triggered via callData or by using the protocol subgraph).  On the alignment with Optimism and Retro Funding - Superfluid is builder-centric. A developer tool with clear focus on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, it’s additive to Optimism’s own goals. - Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries, Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals, Airdrops, Grants distribution as well as entirely novel applications in DeFi, SocialFi and beyond.

The capital for this comes from onchain LPs who passively market-make all trading activity. All trades and liquidity provisioning happens in USDC.   Since our launch on Base in February this year, here's what we've achieved:  1. 29,000 traders 2. Over 815,000 trades  3. Organic yield paid to LPs: $1,742,121 4. Total Trading Volume: $3.2B (10%+ coming from real world assets like forex and metals!).  5. TVL: $12.5M (capped at 15M)  Note: all protocol stats can be verified onchain as well as at: analytics.avantisfi.com  While there are several off-chain or hybrid exchanges available, we firmly believe in constructing a completely on-chain future through a permissionless platform for both RWAs and crypto assets, fueled by LPs and traders. We’re exclusive to the Superchain, committed to building a sustainable exchange long-term, and are just getting started.  In under a year of our mainnet launch, we've established ourselves as one of the leading destinations for Superchain (and specifically Base network) perp traders and LPs. We plan to keep going deeper into the Base stack, having already integrated Coinbase Pay to onramp users seamlessly, and are in the process of integrating CB smart wallets. We have three simple goals:   1) RWA Adoption: Get more real world asset traders onchain. We've already listed Forex (including Turkish Lira), Metals like Gold, Silver & plan to bring global assets like crude oil onchain in the near future.  2) Superchain as a Derivatives Hub: Make Base (and the Superchain) the premier destination for onchain perpetuals trading and market-making.  3) Democratize market-making: Provide competitive and safe yields for USDC LPs on Base, while giving them custom risk management tools. That is, we want to allow passive LPs the opportunity to market-make complex derivatives the same way institutions do, which is the true and original promise of DeFi.",

For example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1) Ugly Cash - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2) Sentz - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.  Reserve Protocol has been live on Mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum collectively for over a year now with no security incidents. TVL has grown to over $160M, 8 major audits have been completed, and a $5M ImmuneFi bug bounty continues to contribute to the safety. Additionally, the overcollateralization to protect against depegs was put to test during the Silicon Valley related USDC depeg in March 2023, which led to a successful re-collateralization of eUSD holders.  On Base, Reserve Protocol has over $25m TVL on Base, $13m of which is Base Native with the remainder bridged from Mainnet. RTokens are playing a strong role in growing the DeFi ecosystem on Base with several integrations and deep liquidity. RToken pools account for over $30m of Total Pool TVL on Aerodrome alone. Growth of RTokens on Base also has second order benefits for the Base's DeFi ecosystem since RTokens are composed of other assets in the ecosystem. For example, hyUSD is a base-native flatcoin that is 100% backed by a collateral basket of USDC which is supplied on Aave and Compound to earn revenue, which is then distributed to hyUSD holders and governance stakers. The market cap of hyUSD has grown to a point where hyUSD collateral makes up 6% of all USDC supplied on Compound and 4% of all USDC supplied on Aave!  I am Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs - the Reserve Protocol Core Team. I have overseen overall strategy at Reserve and have overseen protocol growth from $23M to $160M TVL in the past 9 months.",

It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.  Key Features  Chaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:  Zero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.  Fastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.  Designed especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.  Gas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.  Fast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.  Open API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.  Security: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.  Rewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.  Value Proposition MiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed.  MiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level.  MiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains.

It began as an experiment by Kain Warwick to test the new gas costs after the implementation of EIP-4844. Consequently, a curated degen ecosystem, featuring $2192/$ZORKSEES, was born.  Now, to explain what we do, let’s explore our brief history. Last March, Kain airdropped $2192 on Optimism to SNX stakers and asked the brand new holders to burn 90% of their tokens to be “spared” from the oubliettes. This initiated the first alignment test. The newly formed team behind the meme project, including Kain and his brother Grant Warwick, recognized the faithful and rewarded them with airdropped $ZORKSEES tokens on Base. For the next challenge, Keng Lernitas and Zorksees were compelled to “batel.” The team challenged the community to bridge tokens from Solana to Base using Wormhole, and once again, sacrifice tokens by transferring them into a \"batel\" wallet. The side that achieved the highest TVL would win. In total, more than 40% of the combined supply of $2192/$ZORKSEES has already been burned or sent to \"batel\" for the promise of glory (https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192).  In summary, we are an event-driven meme project striving to create value for our community and allies. The newly established governance, called Keng Lernitas Ekosistem, is asking for a grant to continue building on our gamification culture by hosting more games and events. Throughout our journey, we have made fierce allies from the Synthetix and Infinex communities. Now, it is only natural to seek an alliance with the mighty Optimism Superchain!  Some facts:  -Around $250,000 USD of LP/bribes/incentives on Velodrome/Aerodrome was spent by Kain Warwick for experimental purposes -35.5% of $2192 supply has been burned -27% of $ZORKSEES supply and 8% of $2192 supply was sent to \"batel\" wallet -60k $2192 holders -6k $ZORKSEES holders on EVM  Source: https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192 / https://dune.com/nice2win/zorksees",

These vault managers have special privileges including trading assets on depositors behalf, using whitelisted protocols, collecting management fees, and making updates to the tradable assets of vaults. In addition, users can utilize automatic yield and leveraged vaults.  Through these vaults, structured products can be created using automation, such as mStable and Toros Finance. Some of the successful products include: derivative, yield, and index vaults.  653 vaults are deployed across Optimism and Base by the dHEDGE factory contracts.",

Metronome Synth: Where users can deposit collateral, mint synthetics, and manage their positions.  While similar to other synthetic applications, Metronome Synth separates itself from other products by allowing users to deposit multiple forms of collateral, including yield bearing productive collateral such as LST’s and Vesper Pool share tokens, which act as singular source of collateral value that users can then mint a variety of ever expanding synthetic assets from.    Metronome Marketplace:  The Marketplace is a synthetic DEX, where users can swap between synthetic assets with zero slippage and low fees.  Through Synth and the Marketplace, users are able to place directional trades on popular crypto assets.  DEX aggregators can also route trades through the marketplace to find the best prices on exotic assets, in a capital efficient manner.  Smart Farming: A yield looping engine that routes through Metronome Synth and Vesper Finance yield strategies.  Smart Farming is the backbone of Metronome, enabling users to effortlessly loop their collateral for increased yield up to 5x.  Through Smart Farming, Metronome is able to offer users industry leading APYs, while maintaining sustainable yield.",

The appropriate proof is automatically selected based on the configuration of the OP Stack chain.  The Opti.Domains ENS Gateway automatically upgrades in response to the OP Stack's transition from L2OutputOracle to Dispute Game, requiring no manual intervention or updates to the verifier contract or gateway server.  The ENS Gateway, specifically the EVMGateway, enables trustless cross-chain data retrieval for ENS names deployed on Layer 2 networks like Optimism with a CCIP Gateway. When an ENS name lookup occurs, the resolver reverts with OffchainLookup containing the gateway URL. The client then contacts the gateway, which returns the requested data. This data is passed to a callback function on the resolver for verification before being returned to the client as the final result of the name lookup.  Our ENS Gateway has a mechanism to ensure liveliness even in the event that the respected dispute game type has suddenly changed, as seen in the recent proposal, 'Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,' by storing a backup dispute game type and only trusting its anchor state.  Opti.Domains has also developed social verification and attestation to EAS in collaboration with Bored Town. We are on our way to scaling ENS to OP. We have contributed to the ENS OP Gateway development, which is currently under review by ENS core developers.  The Namespace team has expressed interest and reached out to us with questions about using our OP ENS Gateway.

We build and advance novel fundraising mechanisms like quadratic funding, donor rewards, and decentralized project curation.  Today, Giveth supports donations on eleven chains and networks, including Optimism, Ethereum Mainnet, Celo, and Base.    Giveth has been live on Optimism since 2023, enabling projects to accept Optimism donations (over $570,000 USD raised on OP Mainnet as of March 2025). Through our GIVbacks program, we have rewarded donors to verified projects with over 18.1 million OP Mainnet GIV to date. As of March 2025, over 101 million $GIV is staked in our contracts on OP Mainet, increasing Optimism TVL. There are a total of 1887 GIV holders on Optimism, where 48% of the GIV circulating supply exists.  As an onboarding effort to bring high-trust community members to Optimism, we have been offering 25 OP tokens to each project on Giveth that passes our verification system requirements and adds an Optimism recipient address. We have onboarded and rewarded 4,794 projects through this program thus far.   To enhance these onboarding efforts, we have been running quadratic funding (QF) rounds that require verified projects to add an Optimism address, with the matching pools on Optimism, specifically, totaling more than 163,000 USD.  How it works  Giveth goes beyond “just donations” with the following features:  * GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects have a chance to win up to 500,000 GIV. This fun means of rewarding donors is a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.  * GIVpower - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower give their donors greater chances of winning the GIVbacks raffles. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!  * Quadratic Funding (QF) - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.  * Quadratic Acceleration (q/acc) - A novel funding mechanism combining Quadratic Funding with Augmented Bonding Curves, allowing projects to launch tokens with built-in liquidity. Supporters receive tokens for their contributions, quadratic matching builds secondary market liquidity, and projects gain a sustainable revenue stream, earning a % of every token mint or burn.  * Devouch - A decentralized vouching mechanism that lets people mint attestations and lend their reputation to projects they support for a variety of applications. Giveth uses on-chain attestations made on Optimism in our decentralized project verification system. Using Devouch, the “Giveth Verifiers” attestor group (which includes members of Optimism, Metacartel, ENS, Octant and more) can mint on-chain attestations for Giveth projects. Projects with three attestations from verifiers get labeled “Verified” on the Giveth platform and gain access to benefits like GIVpower and specific QF rounds.   * Cause-Focused AI Agent DAO - an initiative leveraging AI-driven governance to bring funding to public goods. Cause-focused agents backed by tokens on a bonding curve will collect token holder input and allocate funds accordingly to public goods projects within their cause.  Who uses Giveth  Currently, 6,300+ projects have raised over $4.1M from 135,000+ donations from 21,000+ unique donor addresses on Giveth.  To understand how deep our connection with the Optimism ecosystem really is, if we consider only Superchain numbers, we have 4,785 projects, 5,597 donors, and donations that have totaled over $570,000. Devouch has driven 1936 on-chain attestations on Optimism from over 580 unique attestors.  Giveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new donors ecosystems, while inspiring them to dive deeper into the blockchain rabbit hole.  In the last 180 days, we have made huge progress, running three quadratic funding rounds with the following results:  Matching Pools (on the Superchain): $205,000 USD equivalent  Additional crowdfunded donations so far (one round is ongoing and ends April 2, 2025): $90,285 USD equivalent  Projects: 334 (some projects took part in more than one round)  Donors so far: 1719  (some donors took part in more than one round)  ENS x Octant Public Goods (March 18, 2025 – April 2, 2025) https://giveth.notion.site/ENS-x-Octant-Public-Goods-Round-Overview-1983ab28d48c80fd92d3fe688128e189?pvs=74   Loving on Public Goods Results & Wrap-up (January 28 – February 15, 2025) https://forum.giveth.io/t/loving-on-public-goods-qf-round-results-wrap-up-january-28-february-14-2025/1975/1  GIV-a-Palooza Round Results & Wrap-up (September 10 – 24, 2024) https://forum.giveth.io/t/giv-a-palooza-round-results-wrap-up-september-10-24-2024  We have also launched loads of features including a custom donation widget, a project curation program, and streaming donations.",

Basic Dog Meme's initial mission was to onboard users to the nascent network by offering a \"Just for Fun\" airdrop to anyone that bridged ETH to base and requested some $DOG. Over 1000 addresses were confirmed to have onboarded ETH to Base in the first 48 hours of the networks public launch, all in order to receive a Basic Dog Meme airdrop. This activity provided the substantial bulk of newly active wallets on the first day.  Since then, Basic Dog Meme has: - Assisted Aerodrome's team with finding the correct metrics and guidelines for meme coins to be onboarded to their platform. - Pioneered MemeFi by being the first Meme coin with a gauge on Aerodrome.  - Endlessly evangelized the benefits of meme coins utilizing Aerodrome, Base's liquidity hub. Initially it took some time to get the other Meme's on-board, but eventually it became standard practice to take advantage of Aerodrome's flywheel. All because of Basic Dog Meme. - Rallied a community of thousands of enthusiasts, from diverse block chains and backgrounds, to bridge to Base. - Become an ambassador of the arts by being a patron to dozens of NFT artists who love the color blue - Was the focus of one of the first community initiatives to create a meme-coin driven L3 on Base, perhaps serving as the originator of that idea within the base community.

    "project_name":"Trash NFTs",
    "project_description":"Trash NFTs is a project built on Base that leverages the unique properties of the ERC404 token standard. We had the idea for Trash NFTs as a way to combine artichokelord’s incredible artwork with novel tech to create something fun that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible for a memecoin. We chose to build Trash NFTs on Base because we believe in the future of the Superchain and the supportive community of builders it fosters.  Between the two contracts associated with Trash NFTs, the project has generated over 1300 onchain transactions.  Demo video: https://youtu.be/KORe_xnJx1w?si=6V52TlkOfLz3hySz Video of artichokelord drawing the art: https://warpcast.com/trashnfts/0xc65d2a4e  ERC404 is an experimental token standard pioneered by Pandora on February 2, 2024. ERC404 tokens embrace characteristics of both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens: They are “semi-fungible,” enabling both highly liquid markets and uniqueness within a single asset. This allows collectors to sell their tokens when they want and in pieces, if they’d like, as well as introduces the ability to reroll your NFT traits by making more transactions. ERC404s are inherently fractionalized and designed to work natively with existing DeFi protocols. While innovative, it’s important to note that ERC404 is also experimental.  When we first launched $TRASH, we forked Pandora’s contract and raced to be one of the first, if not the first project to deploy an ERC404 on Base. Pandora’s contract was limited to 5 variations of artwork, images that implied a reveal down the line, so we followed suit with 5 closed-lid NFTs of different rarities. Our next goal was to have a PFP collection with the lids removed, so we came up with the idea to create a new contract where you could stash your $TRASH and mint a Dumpster Diver. This contract is named The Dumpster. It is open source and available to any other ERC404 token that wishes to fork it to enable their holders to redeem their ERC404 token for an ERC721.  In addition to the ability to mint an ERC721 by depositing an ERC404, the Dumpster contract enables holders of Dumpster Divers PFP tokens to burn their ERC721 to redeem the original ERC404 that the ERC721 was minted with (retaining the rarity and token ID). A small cleaning fee (0.00042069 ETH, updatable by governance) is charged, and this mechanism can also be used for regenerating/rerolling or ‘recycling’, Dumpster Diver PFPs to get the desired traits.  We have grown to 185 holders and have generated $44k from trade fees (50% of which is $TRASH and 100% of which is reinvested in providing liquidity for our pools), and 1,654,148 DEGEN (~$40k) from liquidity mining rewards. We were also a finalist in the Backdrop Build V3 Accelerator Program (top 5% of applicants).   Trash NFTs have built an effective machine: by owning the LPs that facilitate the swaps into $TRASH we capture 1% of the volume and store that in our treasury. We have two liquidity pools: 1) TRASH/ETH and 2) TRASH/ DEGEN, the rapidly growing meme token with utility in the Farcaster network and beyond. This exposes Trash NFTs to volatility, which generates more revenue because arbitrage bots stabilize the price across pools.   Trash NFTs is also governed by a DAO called Waste Management that was initially allocated 20% of all $TRASH tokens. This DAO collects the cleaning fees associated with trait rerolls as well as the transaction fees and LP rewards from its DeFi activities. Finally, Trash NFTs has entered the meatspace by hosting a trash pickup event during Farcon 2024 with /humankind.   We are proud of Trash NFTs, as it has maintained and proven to be a sound investment for its holder base while operating successfully. There are definite improvements we continue working toward: 1) expanding growth efforts to the broader 404 ecosystem with partnerships (such as Scattering.io with which we have built a relationship) and promotion, 2) revamping The Dumpster website for a more seamless experience and 3) engaging the community to take leadership in expanding the DAO.",

    "project_description":"ZKP2P is a decentralized on/off-ramp built using zero-knowledge proofs that allow users to on-ramp to crypto using every day payment apps (i.e. Venmo, Revolut). Our goal is two-fold, 1) make crypto accessible to non-crypto natives by making it easy to get money on-chain and 2) push the boundaries of how advanced crypto techniques can be used for consumer applications. We believe that we can grow crypto adoption by tying usage closer to the apps people use every day already.  At the core of our mission is continuing to push new user adoption. We believe that these new cryptographic primitives open up novel ways for Web2 data to be used on-chain. However, these new primitives need to be built in such a way that they are viable for broader usage. Our major ongoing contributions to the space will be adapting / building the core infrastructure to be viable for broader consumption. The true magic of these cryptographic primitives can truly only be felt by enabling novel and worthwhile experiences that attract old and new users alike.  We are hoping to achieve this by experimenting with and advancing various other Ethereum Foundation initiatives for enabling development on top of ZK (ZKEmail) and MPC (TLSNotary). Such initiatives benefit the ecosystem by enabling next generation systems that are:  - Sybil resistant: users prove information about themselves  - Meaningful: users are transacting with real world assets they can prove ownership of  - Trustless: users prove interactions they’ve made instead of relying on intermediaries / oracles to resolve transactions  Our first alpha product, the ZKP2P on-ramp, fills a gap in the on-ramping space where users are able to get money directly on-chain fast (no waiting for wires to clear or new accounts to be created with a third-party) while also being cheaper than other direct on-ramps on the market (ie Moonpay). We are able to achieve this by making our on-ramp a completely non-custodial, P2P marketplace. Since our marketplace is P2P, off-rampers compete to get off-chain by setting lower USDC <> fiat swap rates to entice on-rampers to take their liquidity. In many ways you can view our on-ramp as a Web2 <> Web3 version of UniswapV3. The high-level flow is as such:  1. Liquidity providers on-chain (off-rampers) deposit funds into a Ramp contract  2. On-rampers can then submit a transaction to place funds into escrow 3. Once the funds are put into escrow the on-ramper can only unlock the on-chain funds for themselves if they are able to submit a valid proof of payment on a Web2 payment network.  Currently, we support Venmo, Revolut, HDFC (UPI), and BBVA Garanti which gives us coverage for USD, EUR, GBP, SGD, INR, and TRY with more to come. Proofs of transactions on these networks are generated by on-rampers providing data related to their off-chain payment to our zero-knowledge circuits. Using zero-knowledge circuits allows us to verify transaction data without the user needing to leak sensitive data to the public.  We strongly believe that as we continue to improve the tech, on-ramps like these not only provide a stronger and more resilient alternative for on-ramping, they also are better able to meet users where they are at, the payment platforms they use everyday. Furthermore, our P2P Marketplace can be extended to far more than just fiat <> crypto swaps. We can extend this framework to other items like tickets and gaming items, reducing fees on secondary marketplaces and providing stronger protection against scams. Consequently we can unlock value for non-speculators and give more people a reason to transact on-chain!",

In Unitap anyone will be able to learn about Web3 from zero, find new networks and dapps, learn how to use them with how-to-do videos, get free gas drips to get started, and do missions to get rewarded for using new products, ALL IN ONE PLACE. Additionally, Unitap is Sybil-resistant therefore all new users will be unique and the incentives won’t be drained by bots or bad actors.   Most future web3 users have not been onboarded yet, these users will come through the path of least resistance and more incentives. Unitap is optimizing for offering both.  Unitap has deployed Gas Tap, Token Tap, and Prize Tap on Optimism.  Gas Tap: Unique humans can obtain tiny amounts of gas tokens to get started on Optimism. X claims.  Token Tap: Anyone can distribute any kind of tokens gated by the requirements they wish. Unitap distributed OP as incentives to anyone who claimed from the Gas Tap as a PoC and Glo Dollar distributed 500 USDGLO on Optimism using Token Tap.  Prize Tap: Anyone can create raffles and gate them with the requirements they want. Glo Dollar used the Prize Tap contract in Optimism to distribute three 100 USDGLO prizes to users that sent at least 0.1 USDGLO to friends in Optimism.",

Protocol Guild ensures that funding goes directly to these individuals and Ethereum stewardship over the long term. ----------------------------------  --> Optimism's relationship with the Ethereum commons  The Ethereum commons is a broad set of peer-produced artifacts which share infrastructure or software resources. Optimism shares both with the Ethereum L1:  1. Infrastructure relationships link the censorship resistance, security, and settlement of OP-stack L2s with the L1 network.  2. Software powers the L1 distributed system and extensions of it, produced in part by the ongoing research and development of contributors supported through Protocol Guild. These individuals come from 27 different ecosystem teams and projects:  - Client teams: Erigon, EthereumJS, Geth, Besu, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nethermind, Nimbus, Prysm, Reth and Teku - Research groups: Applied Research Group, Consensys DDS, Consensus R&D, Ipsilon, Robust Incentives Group, Stateless Consensus and TXRX - Coordination & support groups: EELS, EthPandaOps, EthereumJS, EF Protocol Support, EF Protocol Security, EF Testing, Ethereum Cat Herders and Portal​​​​​​​  Other impact includes:  - the research, testing, and introduction of blobs through EIP-4844 (ie. proto-danksharding) in March 2024, has lowered L2 transaction costs by 10-100X - ongoing research into peerDAS and related constructions for the anticipated Pectra network upgrade, which will potentially lower the bandwidth requirements and/or further lower transaction costs for users - Optimism’s execution clients are modified L1 clients, which are maintained by Guild members - research, implementations, testing of EVM improvements. Optimism's EVM-equivalent architecture, makes the ecosystem more accessible to builders - ongoing maintainence of code-bases, support for network upgrades to make Ethereum more censorship resistant, secure, and accessible ---------------------------------------  --> A commons funding mechanism  No single individual/project could reproduce this software on their own. In recognition of this, the design of Protocol Guild is also grounded within the commons frame:  1. Four year onchain vest, to individuals  Commons stewardship plays out over time. Any funding drips slowly via immutable contracts to create legible guarantees for members + funders. Each member's share is time-weighted by their start date - which recognizes the local knowledge they've accumulated.  2. Broad membership, regularly updated  Members come from +25 projects/teams across the entire Layer 1 contributor set. This wide-ranging curation ensures that less well known but equally impactful contributions are surfaced. This membership is regularly updated onchain every quarter. When paired with the vest, this ensures funding goes to contributors that stick around long-term, or those that show up in the future - not just those that are around today.  Through these features, Protocol Guild is able to support long-term, transparent, & comprehensive Layer 1 stewardship.  --------------------------- --> \"Project\", not \"Org\"  Within the Retro Program context, Protocol Guild opts to represent itself as a \"Project\" instead of as an \"Organization.\"  1. Fund the entire commons  Protocol Guild aims to holistically fund the individuals engaged in Ethereum's core protocol , and not \"features\" or discrete projects of the protocol which will then compete against each other in the funding round.  2. Funding, not project oversight  Protocol Guild is scope-limited to allocate funding. The day-to-day activities of Ethereum projects/teams are not directed through Protocol Guild as an entity, or by any members in their affiliation as beneficiaries. Governance deliberations and roadmap decisions remain the responsibility of the broader community reaching rough consensus in public fora.  3. Independent funding requests  Presenting as an Organization with Projects might overlap with funding requests from individual core protocol projects/teams in the Retro round. These entities may have contributors/employees which are also members of Protocol Guild. However, these are are distinct entities from Protocol Guild itself. Protocol Guild funding goes directly to the individuals. In general, the membership does not have insight where this funding goes or how it is allocated. ------------------------------  --> Conclusion  Protocol Guild’s design as a funding collective for individual Ethereum maintainers ensures that the network's ongoing evolution is sufficiently supported. By funding Protocol Guild through the Retro Program, badgeholders can ensure that it remains robust and capable of supporting innovations like Optimism.  Thank you for your consideration ❤️",

The multi-proof system was OP Stack's long-awaited vision and a crucial component of Stage 2 because it keeps the system sane when the primary implementation breaks. For that reason, Ethereum has long supported multi-client implementations, and in L2, we need a multi-proof system to fully achieve them.  Test in Prod has been supporting OP Stack to pioneer the multi-client system. We helped execution clients diversify with OP Erigon and have also been working on fault-proof systems diversify with Asterisc.  We have been working on the following: - Upon Protolambda’s initial implementation, we finished implementing all required opcodes & fixed bugs. - Built test suites to run Asterisc against OP Sepolia & OP Mainnet. - Ran all blocks of OP Sepolia with Asterisc to verify its deployability on OP Sepolia. - Deployed Asterisc to OP Sepolia with cold path. - Implementing a different memory structure from Cannon using Radix trie so that Asterisc can save the system when there’s a problem with existing memory implementation.  --- Here are the commentaries for Asterisc:  Clabby (Senior Software Engineer from OP Labs): Asterisc is critical to the OP Stack’s multi-proof roadmap, serving as the compliment to cannon in the landscape of FPVMs. After the rollout of multi-proofs, it will add redundancy to the virtual machine component that runs the fault proof programs, reducing the likelihood of critical impact in the event of an issue with either the on-chain or off-chain FPVM implementations.",

With the initial idea of Protolambda, Test in Prod built & deployed the Delta Network Upgrade across all OP Chain Mainnets. Thanks to Delta, we could see more OP Chains in production, as it reduced the minimal annual operating cost from 165 ETH to 5 ETH (97%). Delta is effective for low-active chains, but active chains, such as Zora, are saving up to 30% of fixed L1 costs with Span Batches.  For the Superchain’s success, reducing the fixed on-chain cost is important. Chain Governors have to take risks for the fixed costs, and it’s difficult to launch an OP Chain if it’s unbearable. Since the deployment of Delta in February 2024, we saw a fast growth in the number of OP Chains, and Delta was one of the big enablers because the risk of Chain Governor went down from 165 ETH/year to 5 ETH/year.  Delta was also a meaningful upgrade as it was the first network upgrade written by the external core dev team from OP Labs, showing that the OP Stack protocol development started to get decentralized.  Since Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following: - Fix bugs in the Span Batches code. - Conduct failure mode analysis & plan out the contingency plans with OP Labs. - Deploy to Sepolia, monitor, and fix codes. - Write & post a Governance Proposal for upgrades. - Deploy to all Superchain Mainnets & monitoring.  --- Here are the commentaries for Delta Network Upgrade:  Andrew (CEO of Conduit): Delta lowered the barriers for Chain Governors by lowering the fixed costs.

Since Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following: - Support users to run & troubleshoot OP-Erigon. - Update the up-to-date upstream codes. - Port Erigon 3, which saves 90.9% of disk footprint compared to Geth on L1. - Host the archive node snapshots for OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, and Base Mainnet—350+ downloads per month. - Host the public RPC of OP Erigon & Otterscan, which serves 4.9k requests/day on average.  --- Here are the commentaries from the notable users:   Raz (CTO of Blockaid): With OP-Erigon, Blockaid could protect users in the Optimism ecosystem (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora) more effectively by leveraging its efficient disk space and performance. Moreover, working with Sunnyside Labs is a smooth experience—they help us troubleshoot, notify us of upcoming network upgrades, etc. We think their works are impactful, at least for us.   Eugene (CTO of Chainstack): Chainstack is using op-erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP Mainnet & Base. Thanks to op-erigon, we could run the archive nodes for the Optimism ecosystem more efficiently. Test in Prod was also helpful for the node operations by helping us troubleshoot, alerting us for upcoming upgrades, etc.  Chris (CEO of Blockjoy): Blockjoy provides dedicated unmetered op-erigon node services for customers needing high performance Erigon RPCs; notable customers are Trueblocks, Blockaid, etc. Operating nodes as efficiently as possible can require true expertise, this is why we enjoy working with Test in Prod & hope to continue working with them in the future!",

However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.  Currently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.  To enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.  Our AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger. We are working with them to make signer proxy perfect and production ready.",

After learning that the OP Labs Audit Framework led to a decision to not fund an audit for the Fault Dispute Game (because the safeguards around it were carefully audited), this project was initiated to bring the top security talent in the space together to secure this crucial piece of infrastructure.  The result was a two week contest featuring legends like samczsun (the GOAT of whitehats), cts (founder of Zellic), Riley Holterhus (Spearbit Lead Security Researcher), pwning.eth (3rd place on Immunefi all time leaderboard), xuwinnie (winner of the largest audit contest pot of all time), as well as 1000+ other researchers.  This format proved very effective. The contest uncovered 5 High severity vulnerabilities, as well as 11 Medium severity issues and numerous smaller improvements. These findings spurred the Granite network upgrade (https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-10-granite-network-upgrade/8733).  My role was to bring the full audit from idea to completion with the best possible results and minimal time commitment from the OP Labs team. This included: - Identifying that this was an important issue for Superchain security, writing the Mission Request, applying, and securing the funding to run the contest. - Determining the optimal format to use the funds to find bugs. After discussing an on chain CTF format, decided with OP Labs team that a contest (with some added features) would work best. - Negotiating with contest platforms to get the most appealing deal. In the end, Code4rena hosted the contest at zero fee (their typical fee would be 60k OP on a contest of this size). - Recruiting top auditors to focus their full time attention on this contest. Selected folks specifically who had the relevant skills for the codebase and worked with them to put together a deal. - Took the role of OP Labs representative in organizing the contest: writing scoping documents, organizing the contest repo, putting together ideas to focus researcher attention on the right areas of the codebase, hosting a livestream to walk through the codebase at kickoff, etc. - Answering all participant questions during the contest to ensure every valid idea was fully explored. - Judging the contest, reviewing all submissions, deduplicating issues, assessing the validity (with the support of OP Labs on final decisions), and putting together the final issues list for the OP Labs team to fix.",

This system allowed anyone to become a validator, who submits checkpoint outputs to L1 and validates them, thereby enabling the decentralized settlement of Kroma on L1.  Additionally, it reduced the costs associated with resolving disputes between different checkpoint outputs. It identifies the disputed point at the block level using multiple segments instead of bisection, requiring far fewer transactions. Moreover, it doesn’t necessitate storing large amounts of preimage oracle data on-chain, as verification can be achieved through ZK proofs. Operationally, we enhanced the ZK prover by reducing proof generation time using Tachyon, a Kroma original, GPU accelerated ZK backend library written in C++.  However, there were several limitations in the existing system: - Maintaining the zkEVM circuit was challenging. - It did not guarantee that the execution of transactions was based on the batch data posted by the sequencer. - Compatibility with the interface of Optimism's DisputeGame was not considered.  To overcome these limitations, the Kroma team is developing an advanced ZK Fault Proof system using a zkVM. By using zkVM instead of zkEVM, no additional maintenance efforts are required for the ZK circuit. The new proving scheme ensures that transaction execution is based on the batch data posted by the sequencer. Additionally, the contract for dispute challenges will implement the interface of Optimism’s DisputeGame, making it fully compatible with Optimism's system. We anticipate that this could become one of the various dispute game types in the multi-proof system.",

The vulnerable implementation was disabled.  The architecture was redesigned and interactive fault proofs were introduced in an upgrade earlier this year: https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161/1  While the research was published in 2022, its impact happened in 2024 when optimism upgraded to the new and safer fault proofs architecture.  Hence I'm submitting this security research in the OP stack research category \"Security audits specifically on the OP Stack or its components\".",

    "project_name":"1-Click Price Oracle",
    "project_description":"Traditionally, price oracles are deployed on a per network basic (on each rollup individually). This manual deployment process can be lengthy, expensive, and may require legal agreements to be signed. Furthermore, prices are pushed to each rollup in a siloed manner, repeatedly incurring all associated overhead. Overall, there is a lot of duplicate computation taking place despite the underlying price data being identical. The traditional oracle architecture is unscalable in a world of 1000s of Rollups.  Gelato's 1-Click Price Oracles are natively integrated into rollups. These native oracles are immediately available without any manual deployment process and hyper scalable by leveraging a unique property of the rollup architecture. Prices are published to- and verified by a single rollup (Hub) and disseminated to all other rollups (Spokes) whilst avoiding duplicate computation and all associated overhead.  The key insight making this possible is that rollups essentially act as indexers over the L1 allowing us to consume data such as emitted events in a process known as derivation. The derivation layer is a crucial component as it facilitates, among other things, deposits which are initiated on the L1 and executed on the L2. This is what allows users on the L1 to securely deposit tokens to the L2.  Here is how a deposit works under the hood:  - The user invokes a smart contract which locks up tokens on the L1 and emits a deposited event. - Whenever the rollup enters a new epoch (new L1 block), it iterates through transaction receipts in that block and fetches all deposited event logs. - For all deposited event logs, the rollup constructs corresponding deposit transactions which are included at the top of the next L2 block.  Gelato 1-Click Price Oracles fork and slightly modify the OP Stack to introduce an additional source to the derivation layer. We first deploy an L1PriceOracle smart contract which receives price updates from Pyth every two seconds via a Gelato Web3 Function. This smart contract is deployed once and shared between all rollups. It verifies the associated signature to ensure the price update is legitimate and emits a PricesUpdated event containing all updated price feeds. When the rollup enters a new epoch, in addition to iterating through all deposited event logs as before, it also iterates through all PricesUpdated event logs. Just like with deposits, the rollup then constructs a special top-of-block transaction which updates prices on the L2. This top-of-block transaction calls an L2PriceOracle predeploy smart contract which stores prices on-chain and exposes them via a Pyth-like interface.  In summary, prices are pushed to and verified by a single smart contract living on the L1. On every epoch, rollups essentially copy fresh prices from L1 to L2 during derivation. Since publishing & verification is done in a single place rather than by each rollup individually, we reduce the complexity of publishing & verification from O(n) to O(1). However, despite avoiding duplicate computation, publishing prices to an L1 such as Ethereum every two seconds is prohibitively expensive. Instead, prices are published to a cheaper L2, in our case Base, and consumed by 1-Click (Base) L3 rollups. Unlike traditional oracles, 1-Click Oracles actually perform better at scale since the costs of publishing & verifying the data is amortized between all rollups. In essence, the constant cost is divided between many rollups (1/N). In addition, whenever a price feed is introduced on the Hub (Base), it is instantly available on all 1-Click rollups without any additional work. This allows us to rapidly introduce new price feeds. For more detailed information, please read the documentation.",

This research aims to significantly expedite the fault-proof dispute by implementing a multi-section search approach. In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. This allows the dispute process for an N=2^48 game to be resolved in just 4 moves, down from 48, facilitating quicker settlements and lowering gas costs.",

    "project_name":"The book of optimism fault proof",
    "project_description":"The Book of Optimism Fault Proof  The Book of Optimism Fault Proof repository is a resource aimed at demystifying the fault proof system for newcomers and seasoned developers alike. Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.  1. Starting with the Basics  The journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.  2. Key Components Explained  Fault Proof: At its core, the fault proof mechanism replaces centralized proposer systems, which are susceptible to biases and inefficiencies, with a decentralized, game-theory-based approach. Fault Proof Game: This component employs a binary search technique to pinpoint and verify discrepancies between parties on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in dispute resolution. Cannon: An off-chain program, Cannon is pivotal in generating verifiable data needed for on-chain interactions, bridging the gap between theoretical fault proof and practical implementation. op-program: This tool provides the necessary prototype files for Cannon, facilitating services for pre-image data crucial for the system’s operations. op-challenger: Automating the gameplay elements of the fault proof system, op-challenger utilizes both Cannon and op-program to streamline processes and enhance system integrity.  3. Architecture Mechanics  Understanding the architecture of the fault proof system involves exploring how these components work together to form a robust mechanism.

Most relevant for the OP Stack ecosystem is that we have built and deployed a dedicated OP Stack L2 testnet Shutterized Optimism (SHOP) with an in-protocol threshold encrypted mempool and are looking into generalizing this solution to more advanced cryptography primitives as well as deploying it across OP Stack networks.    The Shutterized Optimism testnet L2 launch on Sepolia marks the availability of a Shutterized encrypted mempool for the OP Stack, aiming to prevent front-running and provide a censorship-resistant trading environment. Shutterized OP Stack L2s bring a host of benefits, including:    - Enhanced trading safety and profitability by mitigating front-running.  - Added (real-time) censorship resistance.  - Reduced trust assumptions in sequencers through transaction encryption.  - Potential compliance and regulatory benefits by limiting the sequencer's ability to manipulate transactions.  Additionally, we have created the SHOP SDK (Shutterized Optimism SDK), a custom ethersjs provider, that allows to send shutter encrypted (\"shutterized\") transactions on Shutter-Optimism. The goal of the SHOP SDK is to make it as easy as possible to transform a traditional application that could run on Optimism into an MEV-protected version running on Shutter-Optimism.",

Over the past year, we have significantly contributed to a broad array of discussions on improving Ethereum’s core protocol, such as the decentralization of its staking set, its ability to enforce and defend its neutrality, as well as to preserve its security.  We briefly introduce our main research directions from the past year.  Censorship resistance. We are developing mechanisms to ensure the L1 protocol maintains chain neutrality by empowering Ethereum’s decentralized set of validators to enforce the inclusion of transactions in Ethereum blocks through inclusion lists (ILs). Over the past year, we have explored the design space and made significant progress towards a proposal called Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), which we believe could be considered for inclusion in a future Ethereum upgrade. We have also collaborated with the Commit-Boost effort to develop out-of-protocol inclusion lists bridging the gap until a protocol solution is available.  Timing games. Nearly a year ago, we named and introduced the concept of timing games in a publication, describing how proposers have an incentive to wait until the last moment to propose their blocks in order to maximize MEV rewards. Since then, we have observed timing games occurring in practice and have been working on mitigation strategies to maintain consensus stability. Timing games were central to critical discussions by the Ethereum research and builder communities over the last year.  PBS. Our group has been at the forefront of PBS research for more than two years now. During the time period considered for this retroactive funding, we have deepened our understanding of the practice of PBS with research supporting EIP-7732 (“Enshrined Proposer–Builder Separation”). We have also been active in exploring MEV burn mechanisms, as well as the newer idea of “Attester–Proposer Separation”, with posts and publications.  Staking economics. This group put forward the idea of rainbow staking dealing with an ever-changing staking landscape. It intends to embrace the heterogeneity of Ethereum's staking set and foresees different roles for different types of participants. Separately but related, this group has proposed changes to Ethereum's issuance policy in order to maintain a healthy staking level that is long-term sustainable.

Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.  The project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.  In the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.  For the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions.",

As the gas cost dropped with the maturity of L2s and the need for more decentralized and trustless voting grew, we developed Snapshot X, an onchain voting protocol. Unlike the original Snapshot, Snapshot X operates fully onchain using a set of modular smart contracts. This shift makes Snapshot censorship resistant, with onchain and cross-chain voting power computation and trustless execution, while keeping gas costs to the minimal extent possible.",

Our team of 4 experts in social choice theory, modeling and simulations, and token engineering (Nimrod Talmon, PhD, Angela Kreitenweis, Eyal Briman, and Muhammad Idrees) has now gone beyond the Mission Request’s scope to analyze actual Optimism Retro Funding voting designs and improve governance performance by proposing new, strategyproof voting rules.  **Deliverables by September 18:**  - Voting Design Mathematical Specification: Deriving the formal specification of the exact voting rules applied in Optimism’s Retro Funding Rounds 1–4 (R1–4) to allow for rigorous, axiomatic analysis  - Voting Design Evaluation Framework: Deriving a 360° evaluation framework based on Optimism Retro Funding objectives  - Voting Design Evaluation Metrics: Developing metrics to rigorously verify voting designs against Retro Funding objectives, applying theoretical, axiomatic analysis and agent-based simulations   - Testing and Verification of Optimism’s R1–4 Voting Rules: Verifying if the R1–4 voting rules satisfy Incentive Compatibility so that voters can not improve their results by lying about their preferences (known as “strategyproofness” in social choice theory)  - Detection of Major Flaws in Optimism Retro Funding: We found major flaws in the Optimism Retro Funding voting designs (none of the R1–4 voting designs satisfy strategyproofness!)  - Provided two Strategyproof Solutions: GovXS proposed two alternative voting designs to solve strategyproofness and meet Optimism Retro Funding’s design goals   ** Links:**  1) Making Optimism Retro Funding Strategyproof (Report) – https://mirror.xyz/0x803860D2C333734cD99625d8d189d0Eb2e565166/gvjQpafjVxAeeQnb7_Oc--5Oc7chV55zwR_NCa1_9KU  2) A Social Choice Analysis of Retroactive Funding (PDF) – https://github.com/GovXS/Evaluating-Voting-Design-Tradeoffs-for-Retro-Funding/blob/main/A%20Social%20Choice%20Analysis%20of%20Retroactive%20Funding.pdf  3) GovXS Retro Funding Simulator (Open-source) – https://github.com/GovXS/Evaluating-Voting-Design-Tradeoffs-for-Retro-Funding   **Positive impact:**  - Securing Truthful Voting: Using strategyproof voting designs ensures that voters can achieve their best results only by voting according to their true preferences. Current Retro Funding voting designs are not strategyproof. We propose alternative voting designs to solve this issue.  - Securing Expert/Guest Voter Experiments: Optimism Retro Funding is running experiments with badgeholders, guest voters, and expert voters, investing sizably to gain insights on how to best select the most knowledgeable, value-aligned voters. These insights rely on learnings from analyzing voting data and voter preferences. If this data is skewed due to voting designs not being strategyproof, wrong conclusions will be drawn, creating negative impacts e.g. on future rounds’ scope and size, or voter and project participation, hurting the entire ecosystem.  - Securing “Impact = Profit”: Optimism's vision is to build a global system where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the individual, so that “Impact = Profit”. Retro Funding aims to find the ground truth in funding allocation. There is no instrument or algorithm yet to measure a project’s positive impact and the respective profit it deserves. That’s why you, as a voter, are asked to assess project applications by voting in Retro Funding. If the voting rule provides voters with the wrong incentives, the results will be distorted, and Optimism Retro Funding cannot get any closer to reaching a fair, objective truth supporting “Impact = Profit”.",

During Retro Funding 4 (Onchain Builders), we collaborated closely with the Citizens House to develop a comprehensive suite of onchain impact metrics and power the first \"metrics-based voting\" experiment.  We created a first-of-its-kind data pipeline for the Superchain: not only the data but also all source code, query logic, and underlying infrastructure is publicly available for use. With data generously provided by Goldsky, we built a unified Superchain event model covering all OP Stack chains (OP Mainnet, Base, Fraxtal, Metal, Mode, and Zora). We wrote custom logic for discovering contract deployments and attributing them to specific projects per RF4 requirements. With our friends at OpenRank, Passport, and the OP Labs data team, we designed a \"trusted user model\", intended to identify transaction and onchain activity from high reputation users. These models provided the foundation for calculating a range of quantitative indicators to assess the contributions of onchain builders across these chains. All methodologies, data sources, and analysis tools used in developing these metrics are publicly available.  We also maintain an important community resource called OSS Directory: a public repository of Optimism projects and their associated GitHub repos, NPM packages, deployers, contracts, and other open source artifacts, with a strict schema and validation logic to ensure consistency. There are more than 500 Optimism projects in the directory, with new submissions and updates coming in every week. During the RF4 sign-up period, we received 50+ new submissions and made numerous updates to existing projects.   The journey to arrive at a final set of onchain impact metrics was iterative and collaborative. We worked closely with the Foundation and badgeholders to discover and refine the metrics through workshops, surveys, and asynchronous feedabck. This collaboration not only provided valuable insights for Retro Funding 4 but also laid the groundwork for more sophisticated impact assessment in subsequent rounds.  In all the work leading up to the final voting, we maintained our commitment to openness and reproducibility, and wrote extensively about the process to arrive at the final set of metrics on our blog and the Optimism governance forum.",

We have also released a public dashboard measuring VBE across DAOs. (Optimism Collective, as it turns out, ranks #1, i.e., has the highest VBE.)  We can't build truly equitable and durable DAOs unless we understand the meaning of the 'D' in DAO—the decentralization part—and can measure it. Existing metrics—the Nakamoto coefficient, the Gini coefficient, etc.—have a number of shortcomings. We have proposed a new metric, called voting-block entropy (VBE)—pronounced \"vibe.\" It measures decentralization in a principled way that avoids the pitfalls of previous metrics and better reflects intuitive notions of decentralization, such as diversity of opinions, credible neutrality, etc.  VBE additionally offers practical guidance for DAO administrators and users. Using VBE as a theoretical foundation, we have proven a number of basic theorems about ways to increase VBE and thus improve decentralization.   Our work on VBE has involved strong collaboration with the Optimism Foundation (OF). In consultation with the OF, we have developed tools for the OF (and other projects) for measuring VBE.

The Farcaster user reputation scores computed by OpenRank on an curated engagement graph was used as one of the three major data sources, next to FIDs and Gitcoin Passport.   The reputation scores are taken from OpenRank Farcaster Global Profile Ranking: Farcaster users are basically categorized into the two strategies: [**following**](https://docs.openrank.com/integrations/farcaster/global-profile-ranking#strategy-following) and [**engagement](https://docs.openrank.com/integrations/farcaster/global-profile-ranking#strategy-engagement), and ranked recursively by incoming and outgoing trusted engagement signals such as recast, comment, likes on their social graph.** This score is made available, open-sourced and verifiable by OpenRank reputation protocol.

    "project_description":"This research aims to improve governance by achieving more effective public goods funding through the comparison of various grant models. Grant programs play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem, but comparative studies are rare. In this study, we compare different types of programs such as Uniswap, dYdX, Optimism, and Gitcoin, categorizing them into \"top-down,\" \"bottom-up,\" and \"QF (algorithmic)\" types. Our findings suggest that bottom-up and QF types tend to distribute funds more evenly, with smaller grant amounts and less variability, while top-down types exhibit greater variability and tend to provide larger grants to fewer recipients.  The goal of this research is to achieve a more effective and fair grants program. We aim to uncover the differences among various grant programs and provide insights that could improve future program management. By conducting a cross-comparative quantitative analysis, focusing especially on decision-making bodies, we investigated how grant amounts and the number of grants are influenced by different types of decision-making mechanisms. Looking ahead, we plan to develop tools for impact evaluation, impact measurement, or outcome measurement based on these results. This will enable evidence-based public goods funding by using grants data, ensuring that future grants are more effective and aligned with measurable outcomes.  This research and development includes Optimism Collective as a subject of investigation, focusing on identifying the unique characteristics of the Optimism Collective, analyzing the current state of its fund distribution, and comparing it with other grant programs. This approach will contribute to designing more effective, evidence-based funding strategies and to realizing the vision of Retro Funding.",

    "project_description":"Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports and verifies public goods projects, enabling them to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. Today, Giveth supports donations on OP Mainnet, Ethereum Mainnet, Base, Celo, as well as 7 other chains, and several OP Governance projects, such as growthepie, DAOstar, Pairwise, Praise & EAS raise funds on our platform.  Recently, in coordination with the Optimism Token House, we launched DeVouch, a system for members of reputable organizations in the Ethereum ecosystem to vouch for projects looking to raise funding. It was created with special attention to the Optimism Retro Funding mechanism.  How does it work?  By vouching for a project, the organization can lend its credibility to the project, building confidence for those looking to support it with funding.  DeVouch collects projects from Gitcoin, Giveth, and Optimism Retro Funding rounds and showcases them in a single place, allowing all users to either vouch for or flag each project. Visitors to the website can see the vouches and flags received by each project, which were tracked by the \"Attester Group\" that the vouch or flag came from.   Attester Groups are formed by looking at on-chain Attestation Data from EAS on Optimism to know who belongs to which organization or community sub-set by which Attestations have been issued to them and by whom. An example of Attester Groups are RetroFunding 5 voters or Gitcoin passport holders.  This allows members of these groups to lend their reputation to the project looking for funding. However, attesting with DeVouch is a double-edged sword, if a project seems suspicious or untrustworthy then they could also receive a flag, warning others to think twice before supporting this project.  DeVouch is open-source and allows any platform or individual to query DeVouch data using our graphQL API as well as contribute by the issuance of attestations using the DeVouch schema. Anyone can also add their Attester Group to DeVouch by making a simple PR on the DeVouch Github Repository  Who uses it?  DeVouch was launched in early June 2024, and has been featured as additional tooling in Retro Funding 5. Giveth is also integrating it to provide Decentralized Verification of projects seeking funding on the platform.  Considering that we launched on June 12th of this year, the over 700 onchain attestations that’ve happened through DeVouch before September 18th shows that there are good expectations, regarding the growth of users.  Also, to map potential, we look at the demand for such a service, and specifically with Optimism, we have over 591 projects (according to Alchemy) between dApps, dexes, etc., which are all looking to take fundraising opportunities and a piece of the $3.3B in Public Goods funding that was set aside by the Optimism Collective.   A decentralized vouching system is essential to bringing more efficiency to allocating funds, as well as to map the reputation of each project by the entire Optimism Community. Is a project a scam? Flag it! Is a project legit? Vouch for it!  Giveth is known for its ability to support projects in their fundraising effort, and yes from October 2023 until September 18th 2024 we facilitated nearly $1M of donations to projects on our platform, and rewarded donors via our GIVbacks program. But our efforts to verify projects are legitimate is often forgotten. With DeVouch, we are decentralizing this effort and enabling other programs, especially in the Superchain, to also verify that the projects applying for funding are legitimate.",

Our founding members include delegates from Blockchain@USC actively participating in Optimism's governance. With expertise spanning software engineering, product design, and product management across both Web2 and crypto landscapes, our diverse team is dedicated to enhancing the delegate experience.  Our Story  Being a delegate requires constantly staying up-to-date due to the sheer volume of information that needs to be digested. Before Tribuni, we experienced firsthand the challenges of managing extensive data and keeping track of vital governance activities. To address this pain point, we engaged with a wide range of delegates from groups such as 404DAO, Brichis, PGov, Launamu, FranklinDAO, etc. Their insights and feedback inspired us to build a tool tailored specifically for delegates like them.  Our Solution  Delegates are the cornerstone of Optimism's governance system. Active and well-informed delegates lead to resilient and sound governance. However, delegates need to process a lot of information and often find it challenging to stay up-to-date. We are humans after all.  To help delegates stay active and well-informed, our team launched Tribuni—a free Telegram mini-app built exclusively for delegates. Tribuni sends quality AI-generated proposal summaries, vote reminders, and OP forum activity digests directly via Telegram. This ensures that delegates never miss a vote or an important discussion within the OP ecosystem, as long as they're connected to Telegram.  Impact  As of September 2024, Tribuni proudly supports 28 OP delegate profiles, encompassing a staggering 28,217,127 votes combined. This substantial vote power not only surpasses Optimism's 26 million quorum but also underscores Tribuni's pivotal role in the governance ecosystem. Our platform serves 38 dedicated Optimism subscribers, including influential entities like PGOV, blockchain@USC, 404DAO, PGov, Gauntlet, Tane Gov, etc who manage multiple delegate memberships. Through Tribuni, we help them analyzed 1,113 posts across 186 forum topics, ensuring they remain well-informed and proactive in decision-making. By seamlessly integrating into their workflows, Tribuni has become an indispensable tool, empowering delegates to govern more effectively and maintain the resilience of Optimism's governance structure.",

    "project_description":"[WHAT WE DID]  This web app https://devrankings.openrank.com/ enables any community or project to create your own Developer and Github repository rankings, using Github developer activity graph. The GitHub data is public from by Open Source Observer. The ranking and reputation compute is permissionless and verifiable, powered by OpenRank Protocol. Communities can leverage this tool to generate developer and repo reputation scores given their own seed trust.   This tool helps everyone to have a quick understanding of how the developer and repo reputation scores are generated, through the step-by-step process of selecting ranking criteria, seed trust peers, and strength of seed trust peers’ opinion influencing the reputation score of the rest of the peers.   [OUR IMPACT]  The web app is powered by a graph of relevant GitHub event data from Open Source Observer, covering more than 2,000 organizations and over 30,000 code repositories, was employed in generating these scores. We established two kinds of peers: GitHub users and repositories. We then used a variation of EigenTrust, the Hubs and Authorities algorithm, which computes rankings on an asymmetric bipartite trust graph.   The web app made it possible to generate client-side compute results, and replicate the same computation used in Retro 5, therefore it also serves as an educational and accountability tool for Optimism collective to better understand the governance metrics and algos used in a verifiable and transparent way.   [WHAT IS OpenRank]  OpenRank is a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust. Using graph compute algorithms like EigenTrust, it offers resilience from sybil contexts, provides scalable and context-specific compute, and enables permissionless access to compute and reputation data for any user.",

We host weekly Respect Game events, featuring a unique onchain social game designed to foster collaboration, award public goods creators, and optimize governance on the Superchain. Between October 2023 and September 2024, we hosted 42 events where participants share their contributions to Optimism, rank each other’s impact with onchain attestations, and earn non-transferable Respect tokens.  These Respect tokens create a transparent, peer-reviewed system for measuring governance contributions and impact. Optimism Fractal events are a hub for pioneering fractal democracy on Optimism, providing a scalable model for decentralized decision-making. Through this gamified approach, we're shaping the future of Optimism governance, connecting builders, and community leaders while fostering a culture of active governance participation.  This project is for the hosting, promoting, organizing, and producing of respect game events, as well as other key processes like community engagement and facilitation of our consensus processes. It does include not the development of tools used at the events or the Optimism Town Hall events which take place after Respect Game events, as there are separate applications for these projects.  This work has not been funded by the Collective outside of the RetroPGF Round 3 grant shown below, which supported the team who started Optimism Fractal as well as our work with several other related projects.

    "project_description":"Syntra is a delegate dashboard that simplifies DAO governance by streamlining drafting, decision-making, and management with calendar integration.  In the evolving world of decentralized governance, DAOs have become central to decision-making across Web3. Yet, for many delegates, the tools and processes available often feel fragmented, isolated, and hard to navigate. We’ve experienced these challenges firsthand, not just as developers but as participants in various DAOs.  Syntra is a delegate dashboard born from this realization: governance doesn’t need an isolated tool—it requires an integrated solution focused on people, the ones driving these organizations forward.  Shift in Focus: From Tools to People  For too long, DAO tooling has been focused on solving specific issues—one tool for proposals, another for voting, and yet another for analytics. The result? A fragmented experience that leaves participants, both newcomers and experienced teams, struggling to piece together a coherent workflow.  Our Approach  We knew there had to be a better way, so we asked: What if we could give DAO participants a head start? What if we could streamline these processes, so they can focus on what really matters—making impactful decisions?. Our target user base varies from newcomers to professional delegates leading teams of 10+ members.  For newcomers: Syntra lowers the barriers to entry, making it easier to draft proposals, post comments, participate in discussions, vote, and analyze governance activity. For professional organizations: It facilitates coordination and collaboration, providing role-based access and tracking tools to streamline internal processes. By integrating many of the existing tools within the DAO ecosystem, we help delegates manage governance processes more efficiently, improving not just individual contributions but also team-based workflows.",
